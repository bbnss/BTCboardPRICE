This Python script provides a real-time display of Bitcoin (just BTC) prices using the Coindesk API. 
Every minute when the price is updated, it simulates the flipping of an airport board with random numbers
The minimalist GUI displays the price in a borderless window, ensuring the information is both accessible and unobtrusive.

## Requirements
 Python 3
 requests library
tkinter for the GUI

## Usage
 Ensure Python 3 and necessary libraries are installed, then run the script. 
 The price ticker will appear at the bottom center of the screen. This description provides a clear overview of what the script does, its main features, 
 requirements for running it, and basic usage instructions. Adjust as necessary to fit your project's specifics or personal style.
